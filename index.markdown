## The Bounty
I am excited to announce a unique opportunity:

> A `$100,000` bounty for anyone who successfully introduces me to my future primary partner. 

This bounty will be distributed according to a structured vesting schedule. Here's how it works:

- **Initial Commitment**: If, after one year from the introduction, both the introduced partner and I agree to commit to being **primary partners**, the introducer will receive the first installment of the bounty.
- **Vesting Schedule**: Following the initial commitment, the remainder of the bounty will be paid out in equal monthly installments over the next three years, completing the full **$100,000** payout.
- **Terms and Conditions**: Specific terms and conditions apply to this offer, which are detailed in the “Legal - Spirit of the Agreement” section of this document. 👻

This initiative is born out of a belief in the value and transformative power of deep, meaningful relationships and a desire to explore **innovative approaches to finding love**. It is an invitation to connect me with someone who could be an incredible match, and it's a commitment on my part to genuinely engage in this process.


## Do Dating Bounties Kill the Romance?
![me](/photos/21.jpeg)
When I initially shared my project on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36991616) (original post removed) in December 2021, the reaction was more intense than I had anticipated. Critics dismissed my approach as "cringe" and lamented the perceived "commercialization" of love, with some expressing a wish for a "reset button on humanity." after reading my article.

In February 2024, when a freelance journalist approached me and Mati to discussing our initiative for a Valentine’s Day feature in the New York Times. She posed a thought-provoking question: 

> Do you think that this approach undermines the essence of romance in dating?

Despite the criticism, I've always viewed myself as a romantic at heart. This question led me to reflect deeply on how I presented my idea, realizing that my initial emphasis on the technical aspects of the bounty and my personal eccentricities may have overshadowed the more profound spiritual and emotional aspects of my quest for love. My intention was never to commodify love but to explore a unique and creative path toward finding a meaningful connection, in line with my personal values and approach towards life.


My experiences in past relationships have been foundational to my life, providing friendship, support, and love through every challenge. These relationships have been my guiding lights, encouraging self-acceptance and growth. 

Together, we ventured into new passions, maneuvered through the challenges of personal and professional life, faced profound insecurities head one, and were there to comfort us when we fell flat.

In these relationships, we learned the art of surrendering your ego, transitioning from certainty in our perspectives to the humility of recognizing our mistakes. In these moments of true connection, the external world seemed to dissolve, revealing life as a beautiful illusion, but a reflection of the greater Self.

Though each relationship ultimately concluded, their significance in my life is beyond measure. Aware of the heartaches and challenges each would bring, I would still willingly embark on these journeys again without hesitation. Indeed, the investment of $100,000 into each relationship would have been a small price to pay for the invaluable experiences and lessons they provided.


## The "Vesting Schedule"
- **1-Year Cliff**: If the introduction leads to a committed primary partnership within one year, the introducer will receive an initial payment, which is 1/4th of the total bounty amount (**$25,000**)
- **4-Year Vesting Period**: Beyond the first year, should the relationship continue to thrive, the introducer will receive monthly installments amounting to $100,000/4/12 = **$2,083.33**. This extends up to the end of the fourth year from the date of the initial introduction, completing the full payment of the $100,000 bounty

## Profit Sharing: A Stake in Our Success
As an alternative to a fixed bounty, introducers may opt for a profit-sharing agreement, pegged at `10% of my net income``, adhering to the same vesting principles. This option is designed for those who believe in the long-term potential of our success, both personally and financially.


- **Profit Sharing Percentage**: The bounty is set at `10% of my net income`, following the same vesting schedule as the fixed bounty.
- **Income Snapshot**: My current income stands at approximately `$500,000 per year` gross, with a net income of around `$300,000 per year` net.


### Scenarios
- **Pessimistic Scenario (Decrease)**: If my salary decreases to `$250,000` per year, the bounty would adjust accordingly.
- **Average Scenario (Same)**: Assuming my salary remains steady at `$500,000`` per year.
- **Optimistic Scenario (Increase)**: Should my salary increase to `$750,000 `per year, the bounty would increase proportionately.

This option is designed for those who believe not just in the potential for a successful partnership but also in the financial growth and success that the future holds.

### Past Extrapolations
* **2022 Salary**: `$180,000/yr` (at the time of publishing this site)
* **Current 2024 Income**: `$500,000/yr gross`, `$300,000/yr net` (`2.7x growth` in 2 years!)
* **2028 Income**: If it grows by `1.5x`, `$750,000.00 gross`, yielding a bounty of `$180,000`

## Inspiration
Welcome to toli.love, where love meets creativity meets quirky autism. Inspired by [Mati Roy](https://www.facebook.com/mati.roy.09)'s groundbreaking idea of offering a [bounty](https://matiroy.com/writings/My-dating-profile.html) for finding a primary partner, I've decided to embark on a similar journey. Join me in this unique experiment of love and connection.

## 👻 Legaleze - Spirit of the Agreement
At the heart of this unique bounty offer lies a foundation of trust. While acknowledging the potential for loopholes, our primary aim is to foster a trusting atmosphere conducive to forming high-quality, compatible connections. This agreement, including the profit-sharing option, is designed to encourage the matchmaker to be a supportive presence in our lives, enhancing both personal development and financial prosperity.

- **Fulfillment of Agreement**: The agreement is considered fulfilled when both my partner and I feel that its **essence has been honored**. Integrity is paramount in this process, and I seek a partner who equally values their word.

- **Protection for the Matchmaker**: We rely on the social consequences of not honoring our commitment to act as a safeguard. This means that any failure to adhere to the spirit of the agreement could potentially affect our social reputation.

- **Polyamorous Considerations**: The spirit of the bounty becomes even more significant given my polyamorous lifestyle, which embraces a wide spectrum of relationship dynamics. From traditional monogamous indicators of commitment to more fluid and evolving definitions of partnership, this agreement respects the diversity of love and connection.

- **Primary Partner Definition**: For the purposes of this agreement, the payout is restricted to the individual who introduces me to what becomes my most significant long-term relationship, as jointly determined after a year. This relationship, above all others, will be considered the primary partnership under the terms of this bounty.

- **Lost Job/Hardship**: In the event of job loss, reduced income, or financial hardship, the bounty payouts will be **temporarily suspended**. Once employment is resumed, payments will continue on a regular schedule, with the vesting period adjusted accordingly. For example, if there is a 6-month period of unemployment, the vesting schedule will extend to 4.5 years from the original end date.

This arrangement is about more than just financial transactions; it's a commitment to exploring the depths of human connection, supported by a framework that values integrity, respect, and the transformative power of love.
