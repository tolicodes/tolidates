## 🏴‍☠️ The Bounty
I'm thrilled to unveil an unconventional but heartfelt initiative: 
> A $100,000 bounty for the soul who bridges me to my future primary partner.

This project celebrates the transformative power of profound connections and employing financial rewards in a thoughtful, purposeful manner. 
A quest for love, rooted in creativity and openness, this initiative extends an invitation to intertwine destinies in a narrative of growth, adventure, and heartfelt connection.

Here's how it unfolds:

- **Initial Commitment**: A year after the introduction, if we both decide to become primary partners, the introducer receives the first installment.
- **Vesting Schedule**: The balance is paid in monthly installments over the next three years, rewarding the introducer for their part in a potentially life-changing connection.


## 💔 Do Dating Bounties Kill the Romance?
![me](/photos/21.jpeg)

Fascinated by the fusion of love and innovation, I've deeply considered the essence of romance in our digital era. 

My initial reveal on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36991616) (original post was removed) in December 2021 sparked intense debate, with critiques focusing on the supposed "commercialization" of love. 

Yet, a poignant question from a journalist in February 2024 made me reflect: 

> Do you think that this approach undermines the essence of romance in dating?

Despite criticisms, my heart has always been rooted in romanticism. This journey isn't about commodifying love but seeking a unique, heartfelt connection aligned with my values. 


Past relationships, with their profound bonds and growth, underscored the beauty of deep emotional and spiritual connection, teaching me the value of vulnerability and humility.

These experiences, each a cornerstone of my life, have taught me the irreplaceable worth of love and connection, far exceeding any monetary value. This bounty is an invitation to an extraordinary shared narrative of adventure, growth, and profound connection.

My past relationships have been the bedrock of my life, enriching me with unwavering friendship, support, and love. They've illuminated the path to self-acceptance and growth, as we embraced new passions and navigated life's myriad challenges together.

In these relationships, we learned the art of surrendering your ego, transitioning from certainty in our perspectives to the humility of recognizing our mistakes. In these moments of true connection, the external world seemed to dissolve, revealing life as a beautiful illusion, but a reflection of the greater Self.

Each partnership, though it ended, left an indelible mark on my soul, priceless beyond measure. Despite the inevitable heartaches, I cherish these journeys for the depth and lessons they've imparted. Reflecting on this, the notion of a $100,000 bounty pales in comparison to the value of these profound experiences.

Thus, this bounty extends an invitation for more than just companionship; it seeks a co-creator for a saga of adventure, growth, and heartfelt connection.

## ⏳ The "Vesting Schedule"
- **One Year Cliff**: Celebrate our commitment with a `$25,000` acknowledgment to the introducer. (1/4th total bounty)
- **Thereafter**: A monthly testament of `$2,083.33 over three years`, culminating in a full `$100,000` bounty, mirroring the growth and enrichment of our relationship.

- **Average Scenario (Same)**: Assuming my salary remains steady at `$500,000` per year`.
- **Optimistic Scenario (Increase)**: Should my salary increase to `$750,000 per year`, the bounty would increase proportionately.

This option is designed for those who believe not just in the potential for a successful partnership but also in the financial growth and success that the future holds.

## 🌟 Inspiration
Welcome to toli.love, where love meets creativity meets quirky autism. Inspired by [Mati Roy](https://www.facebook.com/mati.roy.09)'s groundbreaking idea of offering a [bounty](https://matiroy.com/writings/My-dating-profile.html) for finding a primary partner, I've decided to embark on a similar journey. Join me in this unique experiment of love and connection.

## 👻 Legaleze - Spirit of the Agreement and  Ethical Considerations

At the heart of this unique bounty offer lies a foundation of trust. It is designed to foster genuine connections above all. It's about navigating the path of love with integrity, ensuring that our journey together honors the spirit of connection we set out to find.


- **Fulfillment of Agreement**: The agreement is considered fulfilled when both my partner and I feel that its **essence has been honored**. Integrity is paramount in this process, and I seek a partner who equally values their word.

- **Protection for the Matchmaker**: We rely on the social consequences of not honoring our commitment to act as a safeguard. This means that any failure to adhere to the spirit of the agreement could potentially affect our social reputation.

- **Lost Job/Hardship**: In the event of job loss, reduced income, or financial hardship, the bounty payouts will be **temporarily suspended**. Once employment is resumed, payments will continue on a regular schedule, with the vesting period adjusted accordingly. For example, if there is a 6-month period of unemployment, the vesting schedule will extend to 4.5 years from the original end date.

This arrangement is about more than just financial transactions; it's a commitment to exploring the depths of human connection, supported by a framework that values integrity, respect, and the transformative power of love.

## ❓ FAQ

### Agreement Fundamentals
**Primary Partners Definition:**  
*What constitutes becoming "primary partners" under this bounty agreement?*  
Becoming "primary partners" is defined by a mutual decision to commit to a relationship that is considered the most significant and long-term above all others. This status is determined jointly by both parties involved after a year of the introduction.

**Polyamory Considerations:**
*How does the bounty agreement accommodate Toli's polyamorous lifestyle?*
The bounty agreement is designed with a deep understanding and respect for the diverse spectrum of relationship dynamics, including those characteristic of polyamory. It is inclusive of a range of commitments, from traditional monogamous ones to more fluid and evolving polyamorous partnerships, emphasizing a broad respect for the diversity of love and connection. 

Specifically, the agreement stipulates that the bounty payout is exclusively for the individual who introduces me to a person with whom I establish a "primary partnership", or my most significant long-term relationship, as **mutually determined after a year**. This relationship, will be recognized as the primary partnership for the purposes of this bounty, reflecting the agreement's flexibility and its acknowledgment of various forms of relationships.


### Conflict Resolution
**Conflicts of Interest:**  
*How will the agreement address potential conflicts of interest, such as the introducer having a personal stake in the outcome?*  
Should a conflict arise, we will promptly address it, ensuring that the introduction and subsequent relationship development are conducted in good faith. See "Spirit of the Agreement"

**Dispute Resolution:**  
*In the case of a dispute, how will it be resolved?*  
Both parties forfeit the right to formal mediation or arbitration and should privately address any conflicts that arise.

**Modification and Cancellation:**  
*Can the bounty agreement be modified or canceled once it is in effect?*  
Any modifications or cancellations to the bounty agreement must be mutually agreed upon by all parties involved. The agreement will detail the process for making changes, ensuring transparency and fairness.


### Eligibility and Introduction Scenarios
**Self-Introduction:**  
*Can someone receive a bounty for introducing themselves?*  
No.

**Multiple Introducers:**  
*What if the primary partner was introduced by more than one person or in some other ambiguous situation?*  
In cases where multiple introducers claim to have facilitated the introduction to the primary partner, or the introduction is unclear (for example, reading a newspaper article), the matched parties will individually evaluate the significance of each introduction's role and timing to make a final decision.

### Financial Aspects
**End of Relationship:**  
*What happens if the relationship ends before the full $100,000 is paid out?*  
If the relationship ends before the full amount is paid, the vesting schedule is halted, and no further payments will be made. The agreement specifies the conditions under which the payouts cease, emphasizing the importance of the relationship's longevity to the bounty's continuation.
