## 🏴‍☠️ The Bounty
I am excited to announce a unique opportunity:

> A `$100,000` bounty for anyone who successfully introduces me to my future primary partner. 

This bounty will be distributed according to a structured vesting schedule. Here's how it works:

- **Initial Commitment**: If, after one year from the introduction, both the introduced partner and I agree to commit to being **primary partners**, the introducer will receive the first installment of the bounty.
- **Vesting Schedule**: Following the initial commitment, the remainder of the bounty will be paid out in equal monthly installments over the next three years, completing the full **$100,000** payout.
- **Terms and Conditions**: Specific terms and conditions apply to this offer, which are detailed in the “Legal - Spirit of the Agreement” section of this document. 👻

This initiative is born out of a belief in the value and transformative power of deep, meaningful relationships and a desire to explore **innovative approaches to finding love**. It is an invitation to connect me with someone who could be an incredible match, and it's a commitment on my part to genuinely engage in this process.


## 💔 Do Dating Bounties Kill the Romance?
![me](/photos/21.jpeg)
When I initially shared my project on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36991616) (original post removed) in December 2021, the reaction was more intense than I had anticipated. Critics dismissed my approach as "cringe" and lamented the perceived "commercialization" of love, with some expressing a wish for a "reset button on humanity." after reading my article.

In February 2024, when a freelance journalist approached me and Mati to discussing our initiative for a Valentine’s Day feature in the New York Times. She posed a thought-provoking question: 

> Do you think that this approach undermines the essence of romance in dating?

Despite the criticism, I've always viewed myself as a romantic at heart. This question led me to reflect deeply on how I presented my idea, realizing that my initial emphasis on the technical aspects of the bounty and my personal eccentricities may have overshadowed the more profound spiritual and emotional aspects of my quest for love. My intention was never to commodify love but to explore a unique and creative path toward finding a meaningful connection, in line with my personal values and approach towards life.


My experiences in past relationships have been foundational to my life, providing friendship, support, and love through every challenge. These relationships have been my guiding lights, encouraging self-acceptance and growth. 

Together, we ventured into new passions, maneuvered through the challenges of personal and professional life, faced profound insecurities head one, and were there to comfort us when we fell flat.

In these relationships, we learned the art of surrendering your ego, transitioning from certainty in our perspectives to the humility of recognizing our mistakes. In these moments of true connection, the external world seemed to dissolve, revealing life as a beautiful illusion, but a reflection of the greater Self.

Though each relationship ultimately concluded, their significance in my life is beyond measure. Aware of the heartaches and challenges each would bring, I would still willingly embark on these journeys again without hesitation. Indeed, the investment of $100,000 into each relationship would have been a small price to pay for the invaluable experiences and lessons they provided.


## ⏳ The "Vesting Schedule"
- **1-Year Cliff**: If the introduction leads to a committed primary partnership within one year, the introducer will receive an initial payment, which is 1/4th of the total bounty amount (**$25,000**)
- **4-Year Vesting Period**: Beyond the first year, should the relationship continue to thrive, the introducer will receive monthly installments amounting to $100,000/4/12 = **$2,083.33**. This extends up to the end of the fourth year from the date of the initial introduction, completing the full payment of the $100,000 bounty

## 📈 Profit Sharing: A Stake in Our Success
As an alternative to a fixed bounty, introducers may opt for a profit-sharing agreement, pegged at `10% of my net income``, adhering to the same vesting principles. This option is designed for those who believe in the long-term potential of our success, both personally and financially.

- **Profit Sharing Percentage**: The bounty is set at `10% of my net income`, following the same vesting schedule as the fixed bounty.
- **Income Snapshot**: My current income stands at approximately `$500,000 per year` gross, with a net income of around `$300,000 per year` net.


### 🌈 Scenarios
- **Pessimistic Scenario (Decrease)**: If my salary decreases to `$250,000` per year, the bounty would adjust accordingly.
- **Average Scenario (Same)**: Assuming my salary remains steady at `$500,000`` per year.
- **Optimistic Scenario (Increase)**: Should my salary increase to `$750,000 `per year, the bounty would increase proportionately.

This option is designed for those who believe not just in the potential for a successful partnership but also in the financial growth and success that the future holds.

### 📈 Past Extrapolations
* **2022 Salary**: `$180,000/yr` (at the time of publishing this site)
* **Current 2024 Income**: `$500,000/yr gross`, `$300,000/yr net` (`2.7x growth` in 2 years!)
* **2028 Income**: If it grows by `1.5x`, `$750,000.00 gross`, yielding a bounty of `$180,000`

## 🌟 Inspiration
Welcome to toli.love, where love meets creativity meets quirky autism. Inspired by [Mati Roy](https://www.facebook.com/mati.roy.09)'s groundbreaking idea of offering a [bounty](https://matiroy.com/writings/My-dating-profile.html) for finding a primary partner, I've decided to embark on a similar journey. Join me in this unique experiment of love and connection.

## 👻 Legaleze - Spirit of the Agreement
At the heart of this unique bounty offer lies a foundation of trust. While acknowledging the potential for loopholes, our primary aim is to foster a trusting atmosphere conducive to forming high-quality, compatible connections. This agreement, including the profit-sharing option, is designed to encourage the matchmaker to be a supportive presence in our lives, enhancing both personal development and financial prosperity.

- **Fulfillment of Agreement**: The agreement is considered fulfilled when both my partner and I feel that its **essence has been honored**. Integrity is paramount in this process, and I seek a partner who equally values their word.

- **Protection for the Matchmaker**: We rely on the social consequences of not honoring our commitment to act as a safeguard. This means that any failure to adhere to the spirit of the agreement could potentially affect our social reputation.

- **Lost Job/Hardship**: In the event of job loss, reduced income, or financial hardship, the bounty payouts will be **temporarily suspended**. Once employment is resumed, payments will continue on a regular schedule, with the vesting period adjusted accordingly. For example, if there is a 6-month period of unemployment, the vesting schedule will extend to 4.5 years from the original end date.

This arrangement is about more than just financial transactions; it's a commitment to exploring the depths of human connection, supported by a framework that values integrity, respect, and the transformative power of love.

## ❓ FAQ

### Agreement Fundamentals
**Primary Partners Definition:**  
*What constitutes becoming "primary partners" under this bounty agreement?*  
Becoming "primary partners" is defined by a mutual decision to commit to a relationship that is considered the most significant and long-term above all others. This status is determined jointly by both parties involved after a year of the introduction.

**Polyamory Considerations:**
*How does the bounty agreement accommodate Toli's polyamorous lifestyle?*
The bounty agreement is designed with a deep understanding and respect for the diverse spectrum of relationship dynamics, including those characteristic of polyamory. It is inclusive of a range of commitments, from traditional monogamous ones to more fluid and evolving polyamorous partnerships, emphasizing a broad respect for the diversity of love and connection. 

Specifically, the agreement stipulates that the bounty payout is exclusively for the individual who introduces me to a person with whom I establish a "primary partnership", or my most significant long-term relationship, as **mutually determined after a year**. This relationship, will be recognized as the primary partnership for the purposes of this bounty, reflecting the agreement's flexibility and its acknowledgment of various forms of relationships.


### Conflict Resolution
**Conflicts of Interest:**  
*How will the agreement address potential conflicts of interest, such as the introducer having a personal stake in the outcome?*  
Should a conflict arise, we will promptly address it, ensuring that the introduction and subsequent relationship development are conducted in good faith. See "Spirit of the Agreement"

**Dispute Resolution:**  
*In the case of a dispute, how will it be resolved?*  
Both parties forfeit the right to formal mediation or arbitration and should privately address any conflicts that arise.

**Modification and Cancellation:**  
*Can the bounty agreement be modified or canceled once it is in effect?*  
Any modifications or cancellations to the bounty agreement must be mutually agreed upon by all parties involved. The agreement will detail the process for making changes, ensuring transparency and fairness.


### Eligibility and Introduction Scenarios
**Self-Introduction:**  
*Can someone receive a bounty for introducing themselves?*  
No.

**Multiple Introducers:**  
*What if the primary partner was introduced by more than one person or in some other ambiguous situation?*  
In cases where multiple introducers claim to have facilitated the introduction to the primary partner, or the introduction is unclear (for example, reading a newspaper article), the matched parties will individually evaluate the significance of each introduction's role and timing to make a final decision.

### Financial Aspects
**End of Relationship:**  
*What happens if the relationship ends before the full $100,000 is paid out?*  
If the relationship ends before the full amount is paid, the vesting schedule is halted, and no further payments will be made. The agreement specifies the conditions under which the payouts cease, emphasizing the importance of the relationship's longevity to the bounty's continuation.
