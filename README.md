## Inspiration
[Mati Roy](https://www.facebook.com/mati.roy.09) wrote a Facebook post, as well as a detailed [dating profile](https://matiroy.com/writings/My-dating-profile.html) with a very unique idea - offering a $2,000 bounty to person who finds someone he ends up having a child with.

We are very much aligned on our approaches towards partnerships and relationships. So I decided to fork his document and write my own!

## Bounty 
I am offering a **$100,000** bounty to the person who sets me up with my primary parter. Your bounty will be paid in the following installments, via check, wire, and/or crypto, based on a typical VC vesting schedule, below.

Upon introducing me to a prospective "primary partner", we may start dating. After a year we will mutualy decide if we would like to consider each other "primary partners", and your first installment will be paid

### Sexuality
Even though I identify as a straight cis male, I also identify as pretty open minded. If it feels good, I'm on board! I am in the kink, BDSM, cuddle and poly communities. I am still very much exploring what this means to me. But I strongly value both emotional and physical intimacy. I also believe that there are many ways to love someone. Each relationship is unique and special. Needless to say, I value open communication and assuming good faith. I believe that just about any argument boils down to a misunderstanding or misaligned desires. There's almost always a creative solution, though it may not come linearly, immediately, or painlessly.

## Also Looking For

- ü™Ä Activity Partner - introduce me to something fun, new and a little obscure
- ü§£ Obscure Parody Video Partner - just because nobody else gets the reference, or...wants to get the reference, doesn't mean it shouldn't be parodied
- ü§∏ AcroYoga Partner - someone to regularly play with me in my general area (Prospect Park)
- üê∂ Pup Parents - Promise wants some furiends too

## The "Vesting Schedule"
### 1 Year Cliff
Upon introducing me to a prospective "primary partner", we may start dating. After a year we will mutualy decide if we would like to consider each other "primary partners", and your first installment will be paid

### 4 Year Vesting Schedule
As our relationship continues, you will be issued monthly payments for the first 4 years of the ongoing relationship.


| Date | Event Description | Average | With Ver
| 1/1/2024 | You introduce me to a potential "primary partner" candidate | 
| 1/5/2024 | We end up liking each other, and go on our first "date". This is when the clock starts
| 1/5/2024 - 2/1/2024 | We go on multiple "dates" getting to know each other
| 1/4/2025 | If we "break up" our "partnership" (as defined by myself and the potential "primary partner"), you will not be issued any bounty at this point | 0 
| 1/5/2025 | We celebrate our "1 year anniversary". As the matchmaker, you are now issued a lump sum of **$25,000** | **$25,000**
| 2/5/2025 | We celebrate our 13 month anniverary. You are issued your monthly payment of *$2,083.33* | 2,083.33
| 6/5/2025 | If we break up on month 18, you retain your $25,000 + the monthly payments ($12,500). Totalling **$37,500** | 37,500
| 1/5/2028 | At this point you have fully vested the full **$100,000** bounty | 100,000

### Profit Sharing - Bet On Us Succeeding
This is very much a work in progress, but as an alternative to a bounty, you may instead opt to invest in a "profit sharing" model of our total **net income**.

It will follow the same vesting schedule as the regular bounty, but be based off our income at that time.

The bounty is set at `10%` of my net income.

At the time of writing the original bounty in 2022, I was making ~$200k/yr. 

I am currently grossing **~$500,000/yr**, or ~$300,000/yr after taxes. 

* **Average Path**: Assumes that I will keep this salary
* **Happy Path**: Assumes that my income goes up to $750,000.00/yr over the next 4 years
* **Pessimistic Path**: Assumes that my salary goes down to $250,000/yr
