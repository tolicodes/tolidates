## The Bounty 
I am offering a generous `$100,000` bounty to the person who introduces me to my "primary partner". The bounty will be paid in installments, following a typical vesting schedule. Upon introducing me to a potential primary partner, we may begin dating. After a year, if we mutually decide to commit as primary partners, you will receive your first installment. After that, you will be paid in prorated monthly installments, until the full $100,000 is paid out.

## Do Dating Bounties Kill the Romance?
![me](/photos/21.jpeg)
When my project first made its debut on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36991616) in late December 2021, the feedback was unexpectedly harsh. Many labeled my approach as "cringe" with comments that reading about it made them "wish for a reset button on humanity," accusing me of "commercializing" love. At the time, I was baffled by the intensity of the backlash.

Fast forward to February 2024, when a New York Times journalist approached Mati and me to discuss our initiative for a Valentine's Day feature. One question from her lingered in my mind:

> Do you think that this approach is diminishing the essence of romance in dating?

Ironically, I've always considered myself profoundly romantic.

Reflecting on this question with friends, I recognized the flaw in my initial presentation. I had overly emphasized the technicalities of the "vesting" schedule and my quirkiness and kinkiness, inadvertently sidelining the core of my being‚Äîthe spiritual and romantic aspects that truly define me. These elements are far more significant to me than any eccentricity or novelty, and what truly make me an excellent partner.

To those who believe I'm "commodifying" love, I want to share a different perspective. 

My past romantic relationships have been pillars in my life, offering friendship, partnership, and unwavering support through my life's most daunting challenges. They have been my guiding stars, encouraging me to embrace my true self and to love that person. Together, we explored new hobbies, navigated workplace stress, shared laughter, overcame massive insecurities, and comforted each other in sorrow. Embracing them, the world faded away, but an illusion, a mere reflection of the Self.

The value of these relationships is immeasurable to me. I would have gladly invested $100,000 into each and every one of them.

## The "Vesting Schedule"
- **1-Year Cliff**: If you introduce me to someone and we become "primary partners" within a year, you receive a lump sum payment of 1/4th of the amount
- **4-Year Vesting**: Should our relationship last beyond a year, you'll receive monthly payments ($2,083.33) for up to 4 years.

### Milestones
| Date | Event | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1/1/2024 | Introduction to potential partner | $0.00 |
| 1/5/2024 | First Date | $0.00 |
| 2/1/2024 | Dating | $0.00 |

| 6/5/2025 | Breakup: Month 18: Vesting Stops | $37,500.00 |
| 1/5/2028 | Full Vest | $100,000.00 |

## Profit Sharing: Bet on Our Success
Instead of a fixed bounty, you can opt for a profit-sharing agreement, calculated as a percentage of **my net income**, following the same vesting schedule.

- **Percentage**: The bounty is set at `10%` of my net income.
- **Current Income**: Roughly `$500,000/yr` gross, $300,000/yr net.

### Scenarios
- **Pessimistic**: If my salary decreases to `$250,000/yr`
- **Average**: Maintaining a salary of `$500,000/yr`
- **Happy**: If my salary increases to `$750,000/yr`

### Past Extrapolations
* **2022 Salary**: `$180,000/yr` (at the time of publishing this site)
* **Current 2024 Income**: `$500,000/yr gross`, `$300,000/yr net` (`2.7x growth` in 2 years!)
* **2028 Income**: If it grows by `1.5x`, `$750,000.00 gross`, yielding a bounty of `$180,000`

| Type            | Pessimistic Path | Average Path (No Change) | Happy Path  |
