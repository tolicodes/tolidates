# Introduction
Welcome to toli.love, where love meets creativity meets quirky autism. Inspired by [Mati Roy](https://www.facebook.com/mati.roy.09)'s groundbreaking idea of offering a [bounty](https://matiroy.com/writings/My-dating-profile.html) for finding a primary partner, I've decided to embark on a similar journey. Join me in this unique experiment of love and connection.


# Bounty 
I am offering a generous **$100,000** bounty to the person who introduces me to my primary partner. The bounty will be paid in installments, following a typical vesting schedule. Upon introducing me to a potential primary partner, we may begin dating. After a year, if we mutually decide to commit as primary partners, you will receive your first installment.

# "Cringe"
When my project first made its debut on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36991616) in late December 2021, the feedback was unexpectedly harsh. Many labeled my approach as "cringe" with comments that reading about it made them "wish for a reset button on humanity," accusing me of "commercializing" love. At the time, I was baffled by the intensity of the backlash.

Fast forward to February 2024, when a New York Times journalist approached Mati and me to discuss our initiative for a Valentine's Day feature. One question from her lingered in my mind:

> Do you think that this approach is diminishing the essence of romance in dating?

Ironically, I've always considered myself profoundly romantic.

Reflecting on this question with friends, I recognized the flaw in my initial presentation. I had overly emphasized the technicalities of the "vesting" schedule and my quirkiness and kinkiness, inadvertently sidelining the core of my being‚Äîthe spiritual and romantic aspects that truly define me. These elements are far more significant to me than any eccentricity or novelty, and what truly make me an excellent partner.

To those who believe I'm "commodifying" love, I want to share a different perspective. 

My past romantic relationships have been pillars in my life, offering friendship, partnership, and unwavering support through my life's most daunting challenges. They have been my guiding stars, encouraging me to embrace my true self and to love that person. Together, we explored new hobbies, navigated workplace stress, shared laughter, overcame massive insecurities, and comforted each other in sorrow. Embracing them, the world faded away, but an illusion, a mere reflection of the Self.

The value of these relationships is immeasurable to me. I would have gladly invested $100,000 into each and every one of them.

# The "Vesting Schedule"
## 1 Year Cliff
Upon introducing me to a prospective "primary partner", we may start dating. After a year we will mutualy decide if we would like to consider each other "primary partners", and your first installment will be paid

## 4 Year Vesting Schedule
As our relationship continues, you will be issued monthly payments for the first 4 years of the ongoing relationship.

| Date | Event | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1/1/2024 | Introduction to potential partner | $0.00 |
| 1/5/2024 | First Date | $0.00 |
| 2/1/2024 | Dating | $0.00 |

## Profit Sharing - Bet On Us Succeeding
As an alternative to the bounty, you can opt for a profit-sharing model based on our total net income. This model follows the same vesting schedule as the bounty but is calculated as a percentage of my net income.

**The bounty is set at `10%` of my net income.**

* **Average Path**: Assumes that I will keep this salary
* **Happy Path**: Assumes that my income goes up to $750,000.00/yr over the next 4 years
* **Pessimistic Path**: Assumes that my salary goes down to $250,000/yr

Example of Growth:
- At the time of writing the original bounty in 2022, I was making ~$200k/yr. 
- I am currently grossing **~$500,000/yr**, or ~$300,000/yr after taxes.
