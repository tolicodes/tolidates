## Introduction
Welcome to toli.love, where love meets creativity. Inspired by [Mati Roy](https://www.facebook.com/mati.roy.09)'s groundbreaking idea of offering a [bounty]((https://matiroy.com/writings/My-dating-profile.html) for finding a primary partner, I've decided to embark on a similar journey. Join me in this unique experiment of love and connection.


## Bounty 
I am offering a generous **$100,000** bounty to the person who introduces me to my primary partner. The bounty will be paid in installments, following a typical vesting schedule. Upon introducing me to a potential primary partner, we may begin dating. After a year, if we mutually decide to commit as primary partners, you will receive your first installment.

I value both emotional and physical intimacy and believe in diverse ways of loving. Open communication and assuming good intentions are crucial to me. I believe most conflicts arise from misunderstandings or differing desires, but I'm confident in finding creative solutions.

## The "Vesting Schedule"
### 1 Year Cliff
Upon introducing me to a prospective "primary partner", we may start dating. After a year we will mutualy decide if we would like to consider each other "primary partners", and your first installment will be paid

### 4 Year Vesting Schedule
As our relationship continues, you will be issued monthly payments for the first 4 years of the ongoing relationship.

| Date | Event | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1/1/2024 | Introduction to potential partner | $0.00 |
| 1/5/2024 | First Date | $0.00 |

### Profit Sharing - Bet On Us Succeeding
As an alternative to the bounty, you can opt for a profit-sharing model based on our total net income. This model follows the same vesting schedule as the bounty but is calculated as a percentage of my net income.

**The bounty is set at `10%` of my net income.**

* **Average Path**: Assumes that I will keep this salary
* **Happy Path**: Assumes that my income goes up to $750,000.00/yr over the next 4 years
* **Pessimistic Path**: Assumes that my salary goes down to $250,000/yr

Example of Growth:
- At the time of writing the original bounty in 2022, I was making ~$200k/yr. 
- I am currently grossing **~$500,000/yr**, or ~$300,000/yr after taxes.
