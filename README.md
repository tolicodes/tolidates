## Inspiration
Recently, [Mati Roy](https://www.facebook.com/mati.roy.09) wrote a Facebook post, as well as a detailed [dating profile](https://matiroy.com/writings/My-dating-profile.html) with a very unique idea - offering a $2,000 bounty to person who finds someone he ends up having a child with.

We are very much aligned on our approaches towards partnerships and relationships. So I decided to fork his document and write my own!

## Bounty 
I am offering a **$100,000** bounty to the person who sets me up with my life parter. Your bounty will be paid in the following installments, via check, wire, and/or crypto, based on a typical VC vesting schedule.

Upon introducing me to a prospective "life partner", we may start dating, and "officially" start our relationship.


## About Toli
First off...a little about me!

**How do people Describe Me**

Exoskeleton Golden Retriever I'm loyal, genuine, adventurous, silly, love to play, and a bit naughty üòà I'm a bit peculiar. Some are turned off by this. Others are very turned on by it. Which category you fall into? One way to find out!

**My Interests**

- ü§∏ My hobbies/communities include acro yoga, cuddle parties, circling, and going to the Russian bathhouse
- üé• I recently discovered that I like making obscure parody videos with my friends. No topic is off limits
- üê∂ I have a super sweet Border Collie mix named Promise. She is also the perfect mix of cuddly, athletic, calm, exciting, and absolutely adorable ü•∞
- üòà I'm into kink, BDSM, polyamory, and related communities. Touch, physical and emotional intimacy, and creativity are super important to me.
- üß† I enjoy talking about consciousness, psychedelics, psychology, philosophy, and AI.
- üò° I do not hold grudges for over 1 month.
- ‚û°Ô∏è‚¨ÖÔ∏è Needless to say, I am neurodivergent.
- ü§ñ I am a frontend engineer at Dropbox. I'm also getting into prompt engineering and believe it will be the only engineering in 10-20 years.

**My Turns Ons**

1. Creativity is my #1 turn on.
2. Not taking life too seriously is my #2 turn on Even though I identify as a straight cis male, I also identify as pretty open minded. If it feels good, I'm on board! I am in the kink, BDSM, cuddle and poly communities. I am still very much exploring what this means to me. But I strongly value both emotional and physical intimacy. I also believe that there are many ways to love someone. Each relationship is unique and special. Needless to say, I value open communication and assuming good faith. I believe that just about any argument boils down to a misunderstanding or misaligned desires. There's almost always a creative solution, though it may not come linearly, immediately, or painlessly.

**Also Looking For**

- ü™Ä Activity Partner - introduce me to something fun, new and a little obscure
- ü§£ Obscure Parody Video Partner - just because nobody else gets the reference, or...wants to get the reference, doesn't mean it shouldn't be parodied
- ü§∏ AcroYoga Partner - someone to regularly play with me in my general area (Prospect Park)
- üê∂ Pup Parents - Promise wants some furiends too

### 1 Year Cliff
If the romantic, sexual, and/or "life partnership" relationship between myself and the candidate you referred is terminated before 1 year, a bounty shall not be issued.

Upon hitting our "1 year anniversary", you will be issued a lump sum of *$25,000*.

### 4 Year Vesting Schedule
As our relationship continues, you will be issued monthly payments for the first 4 years of the ongoing relationship.

### Example
- Dec 20, 2021: You introduce me to a potential "life partner" candidate
- Dec 21, 2021: We end up liking each other, and go on our first "date"
- Dec 22-31, 2021: We go on multiple "dates" getting to know each other
- **Jan 1, 2022**: We officially "start" our relationship
- Dec 30, 2022: If we "break up" our "life partnership" (as defined by myself and the potential "life partner"), you will not be issued any bounty at this point
- **Jan 1, 2023**: We celebrate our "1 year anniversary". As the matchmaker, you are now issued a lump sum of **$25,000**
- **Feb 1, 2023**: We celebrate our 13 month anniverary. You are issued your monthly payment of *$2,083.33*
- Jun 1, 2023: If we break up on month 18, you retain your $25,000 + the monthly payments ($12,500). Totalling **$37,500**
- **Jan 1, 2026**: At this point you have fully vested the full **$100,000** bounty

### Profit Sharing - Bet On Us Succeeding
This is very much a work in progress, but as an alternative to a bounty, you may instead opt to invest in a "profit sharing" model of our total net income.

It will follow the same vesting schedule as the regular bounty, but be based off our income at that time.

#### Happy Path Example
Let's assume the bounty is set at `10%` of our net income.

- Dec 20, 2021: You introduce me to a potential "life partner" candidate. I am currently contracting for a fintech startup, grossing ~$25,000/mo. Let's assume my potential partner makes approximately the same amount. For simplify let's assume we net 60% of our gross salary after taxes and whatnot. So $25,000 * 2 * .6 = $30,000/mo net. Your monthly bounty is $3,000, assuming we stay at our current income levels, don't make any capital gains on investments, etc.
...
- **Jan 1, 2022**: We officially "start" our relationship
- Dec 30, 2022: If we "break up" our "life partnership" (as defined by myself and the potential "life partner"), you will not be issued any bounty at this point
- **Jan 1, 2023**: We celebrate our "1 year anniversary". As the matchmaker, you are now issued 10% of our net tax combined tax return (let's say **$36,000**, assuming all of our salaries stay the same and other factors).
- **Feb 1, 2023**: We celebrate our 13 month anniverary. You are issued your monthly payment of *$3,000*
- Jun 1, 2023: If we break up on month 18, you retain your $36,000 + the monthly payments ($18,000). Totalling **$54,000**
- **Jan 1, 2026**: At this point you have fully vested the full **$144,000** bounty

#### Pessimistic Path Example
Here we assume our net income falls over time

- Dec 20, 2021: You introduce me to a potential "life partner" candidate. I am currently contracting for a fintech startup, grossing ~$25,000/mo. Let's assume my potential partner makes approximately the same amount. For simplify let's assume we net 60% of our gross salary after taxes and whatnot. So $25,000 * 2 * .6 = $30,000/mo net. Your monthly bounty is $3,000, assuming we stay at our current income levels, don't make any capital gains on investments, etc.
...
- **Jan 1, 2022**: We officially "start" our relationship
- Dec 30, 2022: If we "break up" our "life partnership" (as defined by myself and the potential "life partner"), you will not be issued any bounty at this point
- **Jan 1, 2023**: We celebrate our "1 year anniversary". Our net income actually drops by 50%. As the matchmaker, you are now issued 10% of our net tax combined tax return (let's say **$18,000**, assuming all of our salaries stay the same and other factors).
- **Feb 1, 2023**: We celebrate our 13 month anniverary. You are issued your monthly payment of *$1,500*
- Jun 1, 2023: If we break up on month 18, you retain your $18,000 + the monthly payments ($9,000). Totalling **$27,000**
- **Jan 1, 2026**: At this point you have fully vested the full **$72,000** bounty

#### Optimistic Path Example
Here we assume our net income grows over time

- Dec 20, 2021: You introduce me to a potential "life partner" candidate. I am currently contracting for a fintech startup, grossing ~$25,000/mo. Let's assume my potential partner makes approximately the same amount. For simplify let's assume we net 60% of our gross salary after taxes and whatnot. So $25,000 * 2 * .6 = $30,000/mo net. Your monthly bounty is $3,000, assuming we stay at our current income levels, don't make any capital gains on investments, etc.
...
- **Jan 1, 2022**: We officially "start" our relationship
- Dec 30, 2022: If we "break up" our "life partnership" (as defined by myself and the potential "life partner"), you will not be issued any bounty at this point
- **Jan 1, 2023**: We celebrate our "1 year anniversary". Our net income actually increases by 100%. As the matchmaker, you are now issued 10% of our net tax combined tax return (let's say **$72,000**, assuming all of our salaries stay the same and other factors).
- **Feb 1, 2023**: We celebrate our 13 month anniverary. You are issued your monthly payment of *$6,000*
- Jun 1, 2023: If we break up on month 18, you retain your $72,000 + the monthly payments ($36,000). Totalling **$108,000**
- **Jan 1, 2026**: At this point, we have exited out of our respective startups, and have netted $1,000,000. Uou have fully vested your bounty. So you collect a total of **$288,000** off of our net salary over the years, as well as 10% of the 1M (an additional **$100,000**. For a grand total of **$388,000**
