I am offering a **$100,000** bounty to the person who sets me up with my life partner. 

## Inspiration
Recently, [Mati Roy](https://www.facebook.com/mati.roy.09) wrote a Facebook post, as well as a detailed [dating profile](https://matiroy.com/writings/My-dating-profile.html) with a very unique idea - offering a $2,000 bounty to the person who finds someone he ends up having a child with.

Mati and I are both part of rationalist communities, and are quite aligned on our approaches towards life, growth, partnerships and relationships. 

So I decided to fork his document and create my own.

There has been an instant overwhelming response to this project, hours after Mati and I published our documents, including:
- Dozens of comments on [Mati's FB thread](https://www.facebook.com/mati.roy.09)
- Hundred of comments on a repost on [Carrie Wong's FB profile](https://www.facebook.com/carrie.wong.562329)
- Dozens of comments on Amin's repost on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29547588)
- Multiple personal emails of people sharing their appreciation for our project
- An interview request for an Audible documentarian)

Of course, not all feedback was positive. The main concern that many people had, were that Mati and I were attempting to transactionalize a personal relationship. Of course, this was very far from our intension. Both Mati and I are loving and empathetic people, who highly value open communication, generosity, and sharing. 

Our project's goal is simply to create an incentive structure to help our friends (and their friends) link together 2 intelligent, empathetic, driven, and adventurous humans. 

Our hope is that our "matchmakers" don't treat this project as a financial transaction to immediately extract the most financial value possible, but rather treat this as an investment, with multiple long term returns. Those returns, while having a direct and attractive financial component ($100k+ cash), mainly give our friends an opportunity to be more involved in our lives, and grow towards our goals together.

We would like for our friends to invest their time and energy into really helping us grow, in all sorts of ways. Of course, this relationship is a two way street. Besides the relatively nominal financial component to this relationship, the *real* benefit will be *our* investment into your life, goals, network, and fulfillment.

I hope this explains our intentions. But of course, if you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions, please message us directly. We will eagerly accept your feedback.

## Video Intro
I will create a short video explaining the purpose of this project, and what I'm personally looking for in a life partner, amongst many other things.


## Bounty 
I am offering a **$100,000** bounty to the person who sets me up with my life partner. Your bounty will be paid in the following installments, via check, wire, and/or crypto, based on a typical VC vesting schedule.

Upon introducing me to a prospective "life partner", we may start dating, and "officially" start our relationship.

### 1 Year Cliff
If the romantic, sexual, and/or "life partnership" relationship between myself and the candidate you referred is terminated before 1 year, a bounty shall not be issued.

Upon hitting our "1 year anniversary", you will be issued a lump sum of *$25,000*.

### 4 Year Vesting Schedule
As our relationship continues, you will be issued monthly payments for the first 4 years of the ongoing relationship.

### Example
- Dec 20, 2021: You introduce me to a potential "life partner" candidate
- Dec 21, 2021: We end up liking each other, and go on our first "date"
- Dec 22-31, 2021: We go on multiple "dates" getting to know each other
- **Jan 1, 2022**: We officially "start" our relationship
- Dec 30, 2022: If we "break up" our "life partnership" (as defined by myself and the potential "life partner"), you will not be issued any bounty at this point
- **Jan 1, 2023**: We celebrate our "1 year anniversary". As the matchmaker, you are now issued a lump sum of **$25,000**
- **Feb 1, 2023**: We celebrate our 13 month anniverary. You are issued your monthly payment of *$2,083.33*
- Jun 1, 2023: If we break up on month 18, you retain your $25,000 + the monthly payments ($12,500). Totalling **$37,500**
- **Jan 1, 2026**: At this point you have fully vested the full **$100,000** bounty

### Profit Sharing - Bet On Us Succeeding
This is very much a work in progress, but as an alternative to a bounty, you may instead opt to invest in a "profit sharing" model of our total net income.

It will follow the same vesting schedule as the regular bounty, but be based off our income at that time.

#### Happy Path Example
Let's assume the bounty is set at `10%` of our net income.

- Dec 20, 2021: You introduce me to a potential "life partner" candidate. I am currently contracting for a fintech startup, grossing ~$25,000/mo. Let's assume my potential partner makes approximately the same amount. For simplify let's assume we net 60% of our gross salary after taxes and whatnot. So $25,000 * 2 * .6 = $30,000/mo net. Your monthly bounty is $3,000, assuming we stay at our current income levels, don't make any capital gains on investments, etc.
...
- **Jan 1, 2022**: We officially "start" our relationship
- Dec 30, 2022: If we "break up" our "life partnership" (as defined by myself and the potential "life partner"), you will not be issued any bounty at this point
- **Jan 1, 2023**: We celebrate our "1 year anniversary". As the matchmaker, you are now issued 10% of our net tax combined tax return (let's say **$36,000**, assuming all of our salaries stay the same and other factors).
- **Feb 1, 2023**: We celebrate our 13 month anniverary. You are issued your monthly payment of *$3,000*
- Jun 1, 2023: If we break up on month 18, you retain your $36,000 + the monthly payments ($18,000). Totalling **$54,000**
- **Jan 1, 2026**: At this point you have fully vested the full **$144,000** bounty

#### Pessimistic Path Example
Here we assume our net income falls over time

- Dec 20, 2021: You introduce me to a potential "life partner" candidate. I am currently contracting for a fintech startup, grossing ~$25,000/mo. Let's assume my potential partner makes approximately the same amount. For simplify let's assume we net 60% of our gross salary after taxes and whatnot. So $25,000 * 2 * .6 = $30,000/mo net. Your monthly bounty is $3,000, assuming we stay at our current income levels, don't make any capital gains on investments, etc.
...
- **Jan 1, 2022**: We officially "start" our relationship
- Dec 30, 2022: If we "break up" our "life partnership" (as defined by myself and the potential "life partner"), you will not be issued any bounty at this point
- **Jan 1, 2023**: We celebrate our "1 year anniversary". Our net income actually drops by 50%. As the matchmaker, you are now issued 10% of our net tax combined tax return (let's say **$18,000**, assuming all of our salaries stay the same and other factors).
- **Feb 1, 2023**: We celebrate our 13 month anniverary. You are issued your monthly payment of *$1,500*
- Jun 1, 2023: If we break up on month 18, you retain your $18,000 + the monthly payments ($9,000). Totalling **$27,000**
- **Jan 1, 2026**: At this point you have fully vested the full **$72,000** bounty

#### Optimistic Path Example
Here we assume our net income grows over time

- Dec 20, 2021: You introduce me to a potential "life partner" candidate. I am currently contracting for a fintech startup, grossing ~$25,000/mo. Let's assume my potential partner makes approximately the same amount. For simplify let's assume we net 60% of our gross salary after taxes and whatnot. So $25,000 * 2 * .6 = $30,000/mo net. Your monthly bounty is $3,000, assuming we stay at our current income levels, don't make any capital gains on investments, etc.
...
- **Jan 1, 2022**: We officially "start" our relationship
- Dec 30, 2022: If we "break up" our "life partnership" (as defined by myself and the potential "life partner"), you will not be issued any bounty at this point
- **Jan 1, 2023**: We celebrate our "1 year anniversary". Our net income actually increases by 100%. As the matchmaker, you are now issued 10% of our net tax combined tax return (let's say **$72,000**, assuming all of our salaries stay the same and other factors).
- **Feb 1, 2023**: We celebrate our 13 month anniverary. You are issued your monthly payment of *$6,000*
- Jun 1, 2023: If we break up on month 18, you retain your $72,000 + the monthly payments ($36,000). Totalling **$108,000**
- **Jan 1, 2026**: At this point, we have exited out of our respective startups, and have netted $1,000,000. Uou have fully vested your bounty. So you collect a total of **$288,000** off of our net salary over the years, as well as 10% of the 1M (an additional **$100,000**. For a grand total of **$388,000**
